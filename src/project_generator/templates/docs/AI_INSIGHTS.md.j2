# Project AI Insights (Long-Term Memory)

## Purpose
This document serves as the **Long-Term Memory** for AI agents working on **{{ project_name }}**. It captures project-specific behavioral nuances, recurring pitfalls, and architectural decisions that are not strictly "rules" (in `AI_DIRECTIVES.md`) but are critical for maintaining continuity.

## 1. Architectural Patterns
{% if profile == "mvc" %}
*   **MVC Strictness**: Do not leak SQL queries into Views or Controller logic into Models.
{% elif profile == "web" %}
*   **API Design**: Ensure all API endpoints in `src/backend` have corresponding Pydantic models.
{% elif profile == "system" %}
*   **Ansible-First**: We strictly avoid manual configuration. If a tool needs installing, it must be added to a role in `ansible/roles/`.
{% endif %}
*   **Artifacts**: Always update `task.md` before tool calls when starting a new phase.

## 2. Recurring Pitfalls
*   **Testing**: Do not assume tests pass; always checking logs.
*   **Dependencies**: Check `requirements.txt` before adding new libraries.

## 3. Workflow Nuances
*   **Verification**: Trust the test runner (`pytest` or `verify.yml`) over your assumptions.
